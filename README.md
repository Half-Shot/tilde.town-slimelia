# tilde.town/~slimelia
This is the repository for the source code of my static blog generator I use for my [tilde.town website](http://tilde.town/~slimelia/).

It's very messy and crude, but the owners of tilde.town are all about brualist websites so I'm pretending that's intentional/ ;)

Uses the following Python3 libraries:
  * markdown
  * pystache
  * PyTidyLib
  * BeautifulSoup4
